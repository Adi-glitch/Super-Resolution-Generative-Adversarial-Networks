# Super-Resolution GAN (SRGAN)

# Overview

Welcome to the Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN) repository! This code implements an image enhancement model using GANs to generate high-resolution images from low-resolution inputs. SRGANs are particularly useful for tasks like upscaling images with improved visual quality or to reduce the noise in an image.
